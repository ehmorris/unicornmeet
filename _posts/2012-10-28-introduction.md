title: This is a manifesto.

The term "unicorn" has been applied to a designer who can also code. The term is a playful nod to how rare these people are thought to be. A quick google search will reveal a number of articles that are a response to the question, "How do I find (and hire) a unicorn for my startup?" These articles warn that these mythical creatures are very hard to find, and usually end with, "And really, how many designers can *actually* code well?"

We need to change the nature of this conversation. A unicorn is not a person who simply understands Photoshop and SQL. A unicorn is a person who has a broad and deep understanding of the design and implementation of tools, products, and services with the goal of better serving the humans that use them.

When I started making games with Visual Basic at the dining room table as a kid, I saw no division between design and development. I simply learned anything I needed to in order to build the thing I was interested in making. I saw everything I built as a seamless integration of interface and code. When my game needed graphics, I learned to use image editing software. When I needed sound effects, I learned to use audio editing software. When I needed to make something move across the screen, I learned to manipulate it with code.

When I got my first job, I was confronted with the fact that HR departments chop up this holistic perspective into titles like "designer" and "developer". I straddled the line for as long as I could. When forced to choose, I realized that I cared more about controlling the interface -- because it was all the users ever saw. I slowly became a "designer."

I've never felt at ease with this title.

> The True Way transcends the minutia of Skill. There is no "Technology". There is no "Design". There is only a vision of how mankind should be, and the relentless resolve to make it so. The rest is details. --Bret Victor

By embracing this perspective, we can build a better, more humane world.

Many will object and say that no one person can learn the depths of everything that is required to build something of sufficient complexity. Perhaps that is true. But this is about more than just a checklist of skills to master.

We must bring a broad and deep understanding of the digital environments that humans increasingly spend their lives within. A greater understanding of the interconnected nature of everything that brings digital products into the world can lead to more pleasure and power for the people who use--and exist within--them.

Admittedly, before we can "transcend the minutia of Skill", we must first come to an understanding of the details. Patient study slowly incorporates them into intuition, which then frees the maker to focus on the "what" of the thing being built, rather than the "how."

This site will become a repository of advice, knowledge, and inspiration for those who wish to dedicate themselves to the patient study and practice of The True Way.
