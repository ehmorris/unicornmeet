In the [first session](http://blakemasters.tumblr.com/post/20400301508/cs183class1) of his class at Stanford, Peter Thiel uses the framework of "0 to 1" and "1 to n" to talk about technology and progress.

At a most basic level, "0 to 1" refers to the process of creating new things, or simply "technology." True innovation is synonymous with going from 0 to 1. You start with nothing and create something.

In contrast, "1 to n" is, in Thiel's words, "copying things that work". It is similar to what Clayton Christensen calls "sustaining innovations." While the difficult work of 0 to 1 is mainly creative in nature, 1 to n is primarily a management and distribution problem. The enduring image of 1 to n is the factory line -- repeatable processes embedded within a hierarchical organization. 

Startups exist because large companies find it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to go back to 0 once they are already at n. To innovate, large companies have to find a small group of talented people and literally send them somewhere else in order to begin fresh, without the influence of the parent company.

Startups are a natural home for multi-disciplinary thinkers because they allow them the time and space to consider the deep aspects of a problem and create novel solutions. 

But many startups don't take the revolutionary nature of their mission seriously enough. Too many vestiges of big company thinking make their way in. The 9 to 5, Monday through Friday work week is a holdover from the factory line, not the natural schedule of someone engaged in critical-thinking about difficult problems. Hierarchical titles and rigid departmental structures are more examples of big company thinking.

Undoubtedly, not all startups are engaged in true 0 to 1 work. Many startups are simply small companies engaged in 1 to n work. But for companies attempting true innovation, the highest priority must be fostering the environment and subsequent behaviors that lead to the immersive environment that multi-disciplinary thinkers -- unicorns -- are best suited for.
