title: Don&rsquo;t talk down to me

The importance of design and user experience is obvious to most people who build software. The user-hostile software of yesteryear is being replaced by software that attempts to be as user-friendly as possible.

But the desire to not confuse users often turns into a different form of disrespect: talking down to them.

Features are pointed out by drawing huge red arrows to them. Nudges and prompts are repeated endlessly. Warnings and confirmations are thrown up when users attempt to actually get something done.

What you believe about people influences the things you build for them. Developers and designers who make software that talks down to users seem to believe that users have lowly powers of perception, cognition and memory. Information won't be seen unless there are flashing lights pointing the way. Features won't be understood unless they are slowly walked through. Things won't be remembered unless they aren't repeated constantly. 

When explaining people's behavior, the [fundamental attribution error](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error) says that we underestimate the impact of the environment and overestimate the influence of qualities specific to individuals. Which means if we create environments for slow and helpless people, those are the qualities we'll produce in them. If they stick around at all.

We need a more noble way of thinking about users.

Users should be seen as curious, intelligent people who are willing to learn a new tool if it helps them get something useful done. They want their questions answered clearly, but don't want to be bothered by things of no interest to them. They want to be treated with respect, even if they get confused.

Perhaps the problem is that many of the software products being made today aren't actually helping people get something useful done. They are toys and entertainment. Rather than users being intrinsically motivated to find the usefulness of a tool, users must be explicitly told what can be done and why they should want to do it.
