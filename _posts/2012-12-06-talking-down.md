title: Don&rsquo;t talk down to me

The importance of design and user experience is obvious to most people who build software. The user-hostile software of yesteryear is being replaced by software that attempts to be as user-friendly as possible.

But the desire to be friendly often turns into a different form of disrespect: talking down to them.

Features are pointed out by drawing huge red arrows to them. Nudges and prompts are repeated endlessly. Users are asked to tell their friends about the product before they've formed an opinion of its value for themselves.

Your beliefs about human nature influence the things you build for people. Software that talks down to users seems to believe that users have lowly powers of perception, cognition and memory. Information won't be seen unless there are flashing lights pointing the way. Features won't be understood unless they are slowly walked through. Benefits won't be remembered unless they aren't repeated constantly. 

When explaining human behavior, the [fundamental attribution error](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error) says that we underestimate the impact of the environment and overestimate the influence of qualities specific to individuals. Which means if we create environments for unmotivated, forgetful people, those are the qualities we'll produce in them. If they stick around at all.

Users should be seen as curious, intelligent people who are willing to learn a new tool if it helps them get something useful done. They want their questions answered clearly, but don't want to be bothered by things of no interest to them. They want to be treated with respect, even if they get confused. 

Software should encourage exploration and be forgiving of errant clicks and keypresses. If an action has unintended consequences, it should be easily reversable. Software should create an environment of trust and competance because it will produce those qualities in its users.

The desire to optimize business metrics causes this abundance of arrows, explanations, suggestions, alerts, prompts. But if users are instrinsically motivated to use a product they will explore at their own pace and in their way. Forcing certain kinds of behavior may temporarily improve metrics, but can only alienate users over the long run.
