With the New Year here, and as I prep to leave the country for a week, I wanted to reflect on what I've learned from writing for this site.

Writing is not only a means of communication, it's also a way of discovering ideas. In the process of writing these posts, I've been moving away from considering the nuts and bolts of building software on the web (the implicit field that framed my ideas) towards more open-ended reflection on design and its place in the world. I've been attempting to look beyond the assumptions and biases that frame my thinking and find ideas that integrate and unify design as a practice, method, and perspective.

The word design has come to mean so many things that it now risks meaning nothing at all. But instead of attempting to draw firm boundaries around it, what if we saw the dilution of design as a clue to its true nature?

What if we said design is a name for a universal process of problem solving. From here we see the essence of design in Napoleon commanding his army just as much as we see it in the products of Dieter Rams. Treating an illness, preparing a meal, solving a math problem -- these are all acts of design.

Kenya Hara has written about his idea for the zero point of design. It's the image of human hands. In one view, they are balled into fists to clutch a stick. In the other, they are cupped together to bring water out of a stream. This simple scene illustrates not only the ethical questions implicit in design, but the beginning of the long iterative process that brought us to where we stand today.

But the true zero point of design is prior even to the appearance of humans. It's present in existence itself. The theist likely wants a word here, so let's state it plainly. Humanity was mistaken to believe that a single mind designed the natural world. It evolved from a set of simple rules. Design was -- and is -- evolution, not a single decision. We make the same mistake today when we see design as primarily the work of individuals rather than a space of possibility. 

Discussions about the role of design in business and society are useful, but miss the fact that design is already present everywhere, all the time. Thinking about design is a useful way of exploring the space of possibilities available to us as we continue to shape the world we live in.

My plan is to continue to explore the space of possibility that this site opens up.
