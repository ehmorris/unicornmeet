title: The tension between product and distribution
author: Chad Mazzola

Product and distribution were once separate spheres. The processes involved in making a product were distinct from those involved in distributing it.

For web-based products, these two worlds have collided. Distribution is now an embedded feature of many products: 'Like' to get access, pay with a tweet, invite friends for credits.

We no longer pay for these products with money, but by getting them into the hands of more people, with ads (or other more nebulous sources) providing revenue. Much debate has been had about the merits and flaws of this strategy, but given its ability to create highly-valued businesses, we can expect its continued use.

So how do we deal with the user experience impact of these viral distribution methods? I believe we can make a clear distinction between those that harm user experience and those that can improve it.

Methods that harm user experience require users to do something that doesn't align with their goals.

Examples: 

* Requiring users to Like, Tweet, or Pin something before they are allowed to complete a core action.

* Prompting users to share the product with their friends before they have a chance to asses its quality or value.

* Sending messages through public accounts without requesting permission.

These types of distribution methods should be avoided at all costs. They may improve short term metrics, but will erode any sense of a mutually beneficial relationship between the product and its users.

A much more effective method is to align distribution goals with user goals. 

Examples:

* For a product or service that makes use of the network effect, ask users to invite friends as a way to increase the value they gain from it.

* Offer cash or credit to users who produce an unbiased review of the product or service. It helps future customers make better choices, while potentially serving as a word of mouth referral.

* For games, enable users to share high scores through social networks, both to brag about their accomplishments and entice friends to join and beat them.  

These mechanics provide value to users without requiring them to do something outside their normal range of behavior.

As a designer and engineer, I'd rather build products that didn't need to sell themselves. No doubt, paid rather than ad-supported products are still alive and well. But we are now in the viral age. Our widgets make more widgets. We have to learn how to tame these trends, turn them toward good, and protect the interest of users.
